###Vision for the site

We wanted the site to look modern and a little quirky to attract the type of cyclist who would be cycling around and enjoy taking pictures to illustrate their route. This would generally be a young urban cyclist, who would cycle on their commute and maybe plan longer routes in their spare time. 

We wanted to keep the site simple to use and have easy access to the functionality on the site. We also have used a log in function so that you are unable to view images without first signing up to the website. 

We created a colorful logo, and have used a dynamic image for the homepage with a bold pink to stand out against a black navbar. The image and look of the website is to attract the young cool cyclist to use our site.

###Achievements

As a group we began with a much more ambitious outlook, and we were unable to implement some of the features we initally spoke aboout. However, we did implement the following:

- image upload
- token authentication
- pinning images to a map


###Aims for the future

We have high aims for what we would like our website to be able to do including:

- choosing which images to show on a map, so that routes would be available. Eventually we would like to be able to have each user being able to display several routes.
- Messaging feature between users
- Comments on images
- Search for #'s within titles. Making the whole site searchable.
- Ability to upload and view videos.

###Final Product

This site is fully mobile. It is able to work on screens of all sizes.
