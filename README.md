Cycle hub began as a project for WDI 16, it is a place for cyclists to share their experiences off and on their bikes with a community that understands their passion.

In order to run Cycle hub you will need to npm install the following:

###Vision for the site

We wanted the site to look modern and a little quirky to attract the type of cyclist who would be cycling around and enjoy taking pictures to illustrate their route. This would generally be a young urban cyclist, who would cycle on their commute and maybe plan longer routes in their spare time. 

We wanted to keep the site simple to use and have easy access to the functionality on the site. We also have used a log in function so that you are unable to view images without first signing up to the website. 

### User Stories

 - A user is able to log in and out of the site
 - A user is able to upload an image
 - A user is able to view other's images 
 - A user is able to view other's profiles
 - A user is able to edit the title and location of their own image
 - A user is able to delete their own images
 - A user is able to view the locations of their images on a map
 A user is able to edit their own information

###Achievements

As a group we began with a much more ambitious outlook, and we were unable to implement some of the features we initally spoke aboout. However, we did implement the following:

- image upload
- token authentication
- pinning images to a map


###Aims for the future

We have high aims for what we would like our website to be able to do including:

- choosing which images to show on a map, so that routes would be available
- Messaging feature between users
-
