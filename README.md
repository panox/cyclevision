###Vision for the site

We wanted the site to look modern and a little quirky to attract the type of cyclist who would be cycling around and enjoy taking pictures to illustrate their route. This would generally be a young urban cyclist, who would cycle on their commute and maybe plan longer routes in their spare time. 

We wanted to keep the site simple to use and have easy access to the functionality on the site. We also have used a log in function so that you are unable to view images without first signing up to the website.
